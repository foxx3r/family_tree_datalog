# family_tree_datalog
This is a family tree in racket using datalog + S-expressions

To run that script, make sure that you have racket installed, and then, run:

`$ racket genealogy.rkt`

And then, you'll see the result in prolog's notation. If you want to modify, modify in portuguese (soon I'll change), and for each person you'll add, add it to homem(X) also.
